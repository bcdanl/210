## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "**_Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World_**"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on *transnational financing* that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance (e.g., legal system, rule of law, and accountability) can be significant barriers to emissions reductions.


## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Newbold, Steve, "**_Estimating the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) through Big Data_**"

- VSL is the monetary value associated with reducing the risk of death. 
  - How much value would that be? How can we measure it?
  - How do government agencies use the VSL to decide which policies are worth the cost when they reduce the risk of death?

### Use of Generative AI (disclosure-based)

You **may use AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to support your learning, **but** you must:

- **disclose** AI use when it meaningfully contributes  
- **cite/attribute** AI-generated material appropriately  

Guidance: <https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt>

Using AI **without disclosure/citation** may be treated as academic dishonesty.

## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.



## You, at the end of this course

## Data Analytics and Generative AI

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of AI that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.
