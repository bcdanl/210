- Graphs and charts let us explore and learn about the structure of the information we have in `DataFrame`. 

- Good data visualizations make it easier to communicate our ideas and findings to other people. 


:::
::::


## Key Points in Data Visualization


- A graphic should display as much information as it can, with the lowest possible cognitive strain to the viewer.


- Strive for clarity. 
  - Make the data stand out.
    - Avoid too many superimposed elements (e.g., too many curves in the same graphing space).
    - Avoid having the data all skewed to one side or the other of your graph.


- Visualization is an iterative process. 
  - We should try making data visualization informative as much as we can.


## Getting started with `seaborn`

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/seaborn-logo.png" width="200px">
</p>

:::{.nonincremental}
- `seaborn` is a Python data visualization library based on `matplotlib`. 
  - It allows us to easily create beautiful but complex graphics using a simple interface.

:::

```{.python}
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


## FYI: Python version of R's ggplot - `letsplot`

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/grammar-of-graphics.png" width="300px">
</p>

:::{.nonincremental}
- [`letsplot`](https://lets-plot.org) is a Python data visualization library based on the [**Grammar of Graphics**](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). 
  - It is pretty much the same as R's `ggplot`.

:::




## Categorical vs. Continuous Variables

:::{.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Categorical
- A **categorical variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *counting*.
  - Number of red marbles in a jar
  - Number of heads when flipping three coins 
  - Studentsâ€™ letter grade
  - US state/county
  
  
- Categorical variables should be `category` or `string` (`object` in `DataFrame`).


## Continuous
- A **continuous variable** is a variable whose value is obtained by *measuring*  and can have a decimal or fractional value.
  - Height/weight of students
  - Time it takes to get to school
  - Fuel efficiency of a vehicle (e.g., miles per gallon)


- Continuous variables should be `float`.
  - We can use `astype('float')` to make a variable `float`.



## Integer

- For data visualization, `integer`-type variables could be treated as either categorical or continuous, depending on the context of analysis.


- If the values of an integer-type variable means an intensity or an order, the integer variable could be continuous.
  - A variable of age integers (18, 19, 20, 21, ...) could be continuous.
  - A variable of integer-valued MPG (27, 28, 29, 30, ...) could be continuous.
  
  
- If not, the integer variable is categorical.
  - A variable of month integers (1, ,2, ..., 12) is categorical.


- We can use `astype('int')` to make a variable `int`.

## Making Discoveries from a Data Set

:::{.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}

## Distribution
- From the distribution plots, we want to see the **variation**, the tendency of the values of a variable to change.
  - Which values are the most common? Why?
  - How *normal* is the data? How many peaks are there in the distribution?
  - Which values are rare? 



## Relationship
- From the plots with two or more variables, we want to see **co-variation**, the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a **related** way. 


- What type of **co-variation** occurs between variables?
  - Are they positively associated?
  - Are they negatively associated?
  - Are there no association between them?




## Types

  - A distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., bar charts and more)
  - A distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., histograms and more)
  - A relationship between two continuous variables (e.g., scatter plots and more)
  - A time trend of a variable (e.g., line plots and more)
  


## Summary Stat.

- Use `DataFrame.describe()` to know:
  - Mean (Average, Expected Value);
  - Standard Deviation (SD)
  - Minimum, First Quartile (Q1), Median (Q2), Third Quartile (Q3), and Maximum.

:::
:::


## Data Visualization Workflow

:::{.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}
## Step 1
- Read the descriptions of variables in a `DataFrame` if available.


- Check the unit of an observation: Are all values in one single observation measured for:
  - One organization (e.g., university, company)?
  - One geographic unit (e.g., zip code, county, state, country)?
  - One person?
  - One person in a specific point of time (e.g., year, month, week)?
  - One geographic unit in a specific point of time?
  - One organization in a specific point of time?

## Step 2
- Prepare a DataFrame for visualization.
  - Adding new variables
  - Filtering observations
  - Group operations


## Step 3
- Figure out whether variables of interests are **categorical** or **continuous**.
  - Check what types of the variables are (e.g., `float`, `int`, `datetime64`, `object`, `category`).
  - Use `astype(DTYPE)`  if needed.


## Step 4
- Choose appropriate
  - Geometric objects (e.g., `sns.histplot`, `sns.scatterplot`)
  - Aesthetic mappings (`(x = , y = , color = , hue = )`) 
  - Faceting (`FacetGrid(DATA, row = , col = ).map(GEOMETRIC_OBJECT, VARIABLES)` or `col`/`row` in the function of geometric object) 


## Step 5
- Pay attention to the unit of `x` and`y` axes.

- If needed, transform a given `DataFrame` (e.g., subset of observations, new variables, summarized DataFrame).

## Getting started with `seaborn`

:::{.nonincremental}

- Let's get the names of `DataFrame`s provided by the `seaborn` library:

```{.python}
sns.get_dataset_names() 
```

- Matplotlib provides plot [styles](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/examples/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html):
```{.python}
plt.style.available
plt.style.use('STYLE_YOU_WANT_TO_USE')
```


- Let's use the `titanic` and `tips` DataFrames:

```{.python}
titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```

:::



## Bar Chart 


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.countplot(data = titanic,
              x =  'sex')
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Mapping
  - `data`: DataFrame.
  - `x`:  Name of a categorical variable (column) in DataFrame

:::

:::: 


- A bar chart is used to plot the frequency of the different categories.
  - It is useful to visualize how values of a **categorical variable** are distributed.
  - A variable is **categorical** if it can only take one of a small set of values.
  

- We use `sns.countplot()` function to plot a bar chart



## Bar Chart 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.countplot(data = titanic,
              x = 'sex',
              hue = 'survived')
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Mapping
  - `hue`:  Name of a categorical variable

:::

::::



- We can further break up the bars in the bar chart based on another categorical variable. 

  - This is useful to visualize the relationship between the two categorical variables.


## Histogram 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.histplot(data = titanic,
             x =  'age', 
             bins = 5)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Mapping
  - `bins`:  Number of bins
  - `binwidth`:  Width of each bin

:::

::::



- A histogram is a **continuous** version of a bar chart.
  - It is used to plot the frequency of the different values.
  - It is useful to visualize how values of a **continuous variable** are distributed.

  
- We use `sns.histplot()` function to plot a histogram


## Histogram 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.boxplot(data = tips,
            y = 'total_bill')
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.boxplot(data = tips,
            x = 'time', 
            y = 'total_bill')
```
:::

::::



- A boxplot computes a summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.
  - It is useful to visualize how values of a **continuous variable** are distributed across different values of another (categorical) variable.
  
  
- We use `sns.histplot()` function to plot a histogram.




## Scatter plot 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
sns.scatterplot(data = tips,
                x = 'total_bill', 
                y = 'tip')
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Mapping
  - `x`:  Name of a continuous variable on the horizontal axis
  - `y`:  Name of a continuous variable on the vertical axis

:::

::::



- A scatter plot is used to display the relationship between two continuous variables.

  -  We can see co-variation as a pattern in the scattered points.

- We use `sns.scatterplot()` function to plot a scatter plot.



## Scatter plot 

```{.python}
sns.scatterplot(data = tips,
                x = 'total_bill', 
                y = 'tip',
                hue = 'smoker')
```



- To the scatter plot, we can add a `hue`-`VARIABLE` mapping to display how the relationship between two continuous variables varies by `VARIABLE`.

- Suppose we are interested in the following question:
  - **Q**. Does a smoker and a non-smoker have a difference in tipping behavior?


## Fitted line 
  

```{.python}
sns.lmplot(data = tips,
           x = 'total_bill', 
           y = 'tip')
```


- From the scatter plot, it is often difficult to clearly see the relationship between two continuous variables.

  - `sns.lmplot()` adds a line that fits well into the scattered points.
  
  - On average, the fitted line describes the relationship between two continuous variables.




## Transparency with `alpha`
  
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
```{.python}
sns.scatterplot(data = tips,
                x = 'total_bill', 
                y = 'tip',
                alpha = .25)
```
:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
```{.python}
sns.lmplot(data = tips,
           x = 'total_bill', 
           y = 'tip',
           scatter_kws = {'alpha' : 0.2})
```
:::

::::



- In a scatter plot, adding transparency with `alpha` helps address many data points on the same location.
  - We can map `alpha` to number between 0 and 1.
  
  

## Scatter plot 

```{.python}
sns.lmplot(data = tips,
           x = 'total_bill', 
           y = 'tip',
           hue = 'smoker',
           scatter_kws = {'alpha' : 0.5})
```


- To the scatter plot, we can add a `hue`-`VARIABLE` mapping to display how the relationship between two continuous variables varies by `VARIABLE`.

- Using the fitted lines, let's answer the following question:
  - **Q**. Does a smoker and a non-smoker have a difference in tipping behavior?


## Line cahrt 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.python}
path_csv = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/dji.csv'
dow = pd.read_csv(path_csv)
dow['Date'] = dow['Date'].astype('datetime64')

sns.lineplot(data = dow,
             x =  'Date', 
             y =  'Close')
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Mapping
  - `x`:  Name of a continuous variable (often time variable) on the horizontal axis 
  - `y`:  Name of a continuous variable on the vertical axis

:::
::::



- A line chart is used to display the trend in a continuous variable or the change in a continuous variable over other variable.
  - It draws a line by connecting the scattered points in order of the variable on the x-axis, so that it highlights exactly when changes occur.
- We use `sns.lineplot()` function to plot a line plot.


## Line cahrt 


```{.python}
healthexp = ( 
  sns.load_dataset("healthexp")
  .sort_values(["Country", "Year"])
  .query("Year <= 2020")
  )

sns.lineplot(data = healthexp,
             x =  'Year', 
             y =  'Life_Expectancy',
             hue = 'Country')
```

- For line charts, we often need to group or connect observations to visualize the number of distinct lines.



## Faceting

:::{.nonincremental}
- Faceting allows us to plot subsets (facets) of our data across subplots. 

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Faceting
- First, we create a `.FacetGrid()` object with the data we will be using and define how it will be subset with the `row` and `col` arguments: 

- Second, we then use the `.map()` method to run a plotting function on each of the subsets, passing along any necessary arguments.


## `FacetGrid().map()`
```{.python}
(
 sns.FacetGrid(
       data = titanic,
       row='class',
       col='sex')
 .map(sns.histplot, 'age')
 )
```

## Alternative?
- Some geometric object, such as `sns.lmplot`, does not work well with `sns.FacetGrid()`.
  - Instead, `sns.lmplot` supports mapping, `col = 'VAR'` and `row = 'VAR'` to facet the plot.
  
```{.python}
sns.lmplot(data = tips, x = 'total_bill', y = 'tip', hue = 'smoker',
           scatter_kws = {'alpha' : 0.5},
           col = 'smoker')
```
