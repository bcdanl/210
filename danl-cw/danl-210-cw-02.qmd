## Question 1

### (a)
Using Python operations only, calculate below:
$$\frac{2^5}{7 \cdot (4 - 2^3)}$$


```{python}

```


### (b)

Given:
```{python}
#| echo: true
data = [10, 2.5, "3"]
```

Using Python only, calculate `10 + 2.5 + 3`


### (c)
Given:
```{python}
#| echo: true
exam_score = {"Midterm": 78, "Final": 92}
```

Compute the Total Exam Score:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{(Total Exam Score)} = \max\{ &0.50\times \text{(Midterm)} + 0.50\times \text{(Final)},\\ 
&0.33\times \text{(Midterm)} + 0.67\times \text{(Final)} \}
\end{align}
$$

```{python}

```

## Question 2

For each expression below, what is the value of the expression? Explain thoroughly.

### (a)
```{python}
#| echo: true
20 == '20'
```


### (b)
```{python}
#| echo: true
x = 4.0
y = .5

x < y or 3*y < x
```



```{python}

```

## Question 3

What will the following code print?

```{python}
#| echo: true

status = "Gold"
cart_total = 92.5

free_shipping_levels = ["Gold", "Platinum"]

if status in free_shipping_levels:
    shipping = 0
    msg = f"Status: {status} → Free shipping! Total = ${cart_total}"
elif cart_total >= 100:
    shipping = 0
    msg = f"Spend threshold met → Free shipping! Total = ${cart_total}"
else:
    shipping = 7.99
    msg = f"Status: {status}, Total = ${cart_total} → Shipping = ${shipping}"

print(msg)
```

<br><br><br>

## Question 4


```{python}
#| echo: true
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
```


Write a Python code that uses *slicing* and the `print()` function to print out the following message: 

<div style="font-family:courier">The total trip cost is: $12.80</div>

<br>


```{python}

```

<br><br><br>

## Question 5

```{python}
#| echo: true
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
```


Write a Python code that uses `print()` and `max()` functions to print out the largest value in the list, `list_variable`, as follows:

<div style="font-family:courier">The largest value in the list is: 1000</div>

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>


## Question 6

```{python}
#| echo: true
vals = [3, 2, 1, 0]
```

- Use a `while` loop to print each value of the list [3, 2, 1, 0], one at a time.
- Use a `for` loop to print each value of the list [3, 2, 1, 0], one at a time.

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>

## Question 7
- Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`, and the value 1 to the variable `number`. 

- Write a `while` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

- Write a `for` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>


# Question 8
- You are given a variable value that contains a string. 

```{.python}
value = "$320"
```


- Write a Python program to:
	1.	Attempt to convert value to a floating-point number using `float()`.
	2.	If the conversion is successful, print: "You entered: <number>".
	3.	If the conversion fails (e.g., the value is not a valid number), print: "That's not a valid number!".

- Use a `try`-`except` block to handle the potential error.

<br>


```{python}

```


<br><br><br>

# Question 9
- Import the `pandas` library as `pd`.
- Install the `selenium` library.
- From `selenium`, import the functions `webdriver`.

<br>


```{python}

```
