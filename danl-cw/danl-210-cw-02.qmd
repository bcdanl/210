## Question 1. Python Operations and Basic Data Structures

### (a) Arithmetic with Powers and Parentheses
Using Python operations only, calculate below:
$$\frac{2^5}{7 \cdot (4 - 2^3)}$$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
```{python}
#| echo: true

# NOTE: In Python, exponentiation is ** (not ^)

result = (2**5) / (7 * (4 - 2**3))
```

- -1.1428571428571428  (which is exactly -8/7)

:::




<br>

### (b) Adding Mixed Types by Converting Strings
Given:
```{python}
#| echo: true
data = [10, 2.5, "3"]
```

Using Python only, calculate `10 + 2.5 + 3`

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
```{python}
#| echo: true

total = data[0] + data[1] + float(data[2])
```

:::

<br>

### (c) Computing a Weighted Exam Score with `max()`
Given:
```{python}
#| echo: true
exam_score = {"Midterm": 78, "Final": 92}
```

Compute the Total Exam Score:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{(Total Exam Score)} = \max\{ &0.50\times \text{(Midterm)} + 0.50\times \text{(Final)},\\ 
&0.33\times \text{(Midterm)} + 0.67\times \text{(Final)} \}
\end{align}
$$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
```{python}
#| echo: true

simple_avg = 0.50 * exam_score["Midterm"] + 0.50 * exam_score["Final"]
weighted_avg = 0.33 * exam_score["Midterm"] + 0.67 * exam_score["Final"]

total_exam_score = max(simple_avg, weighted_avg)
```

## Question 2. Boolean Expressions and Logic

For each expression below, what is the value of the expression? Explain thoroughly.

### (a) Comparing Different Data Types (`int` vs `str`)
```{python}
#| echo: true
20 == '20'
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer

- `False`
- Why? 
  - 20 is an integer, but '20' is a string. 
  - Different types are not equal.

:::


<br>

### (b) Logical Operators with Comparisons (`or`)
```{python}
#| echo: true
x = 4.0
y = .5

x < y or 3*y < x
```


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Show answer
- `True`
- Why?
	-	`x < y` → 4.0 < 0.5 → `False`
	-	`3*y < x` → 1.5 < 4.0 → `True`
	-	`False or True` → `True`

:::

## Question 3. Conditional Statements (`if` / `elif` / `else`)

### (a) Tracing an `if`-Chain (Membership and Thresholds)
What will the following code print? *(Answer without running it.)*

```{python}
#| echo: true

status = "Gold"
cart_total = 92.5

free_shipping_levels = ["Gold", "Platinum"]

if status in free_shipping_levels:
    shipping = 0
    msg = f"Status: {status} → Free shipping! Total = ${cart_total}"
elif cart_total >= 100:
    shipping = 0
    msg = f"Spend threshold met → Free shipping! Total = ${cart_total}"
else:
    shipping = 7.99
    msg = f"Status: {status}, Total = ${cart_total} → Shipping = ${shipping}"

print(msg)
```

<br>

### (b) Fill-in-the-Blanks: Writing an `if`-`elif`-`else` Chain
- Fill in the blanks:
  - If `name` is `"Geneseo"` **and** `score >= 90` → print `"Geneseo high score"`
  - Else if `score >= 90` → print `"High score"`
  - Else → print `"Try again"`
	
```{python}
#| echo: true
name = "Geneseo"
score = 88

# Fill in the blanks
if ______________________________:
    print("Geneseo high score")
elif ____________________________:
    print("High score")
else:
    print("Try again")
```

## Question 4. List Slicing and String Slicing
### (a) Predicting Output from List Slices
What will the following code print? *(Do not run it—reason it out.)*

```{python}
#| echo: true
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]

print(nums[2:6])
print(nums[:4])
print(nums[::2])
print(nums[-4:-1])
```

<br>

### (b) Extracting Numbers from Strings with Slicing
```{python}
#| echo: true
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
```


Write a Python code that uses *slicing* and the `print()` function to print out the following message: 

<div style="font-family:courier">The total trip cost is: $12.80</div>

<br>


```{python}

```

<br><br><br>



## Question 5. Finding the Maximum Value in a List
<!-- ### Largest Value with `max()` and `print()` -->

```{python}
#| echo: true
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
```


Write a Python code that uses `print()` and `max()` functions to print out the largest value in the list, `list_variable`, as follows:

<div style="font-family:courier">The largest value in the list is: 1000</div>

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>




## Question 6. Looping Through a List (`while` vs `for`)
<!-- ### Iterating Over Values Two Ways -->


```{python}
#| echo: true
vals = [3, 2, 1, 0]
```

- Use a `while` loop to print each value of the list [3, 2, 1, 0], one at a time.
- Use a `for` loop to print each value of the list [3, 2, 1, 0], one at a time.

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>


## Question 7. Loop Control with Comparisons and Early Exit
<!-- ### Comparing `number` to `guess_me` with `while` and `for` -->

- Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`, and the value 1 to the variable `number`. 

- Write a `while` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

- Write a `for` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

<br>


```{python}

```



<br><br><br>



## Question 8. Error Handling with `try`–`except`
<!-- ### Safe Type Conversion with `float()` -->


You are given a variable `value` that stores a string:

```{.python}
value = "$320"
```

Write a Python program that does the following:

1.	Attempt to convert value into a floating-point number using float().
2.	If the conversion is successful, print:
<div style="font-family:courier">You entered: <number></div>
3.	If the conversion fails (for example, because the string is not a valid number), print:
<div style="font-family:courier">That's not a valid number!</div>

Your program must use a `try`–`except` block to handle the potential error gracefully.

<br>


```{python}

```


<br><br><br>


## Question 9. Imports and Library Setup (pandas + selenium)
### (a) Importing a Library with an Alias
Import the `pandas` library as `pd`.

### (b) Installing an External Library
Install the `selenium` library.

### (c) Importing from a Submodule
From `selenium`, import the functions `webdriver`.

<br>

```{python}

```
