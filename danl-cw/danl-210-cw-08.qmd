# Question 1

- Store the table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [Gasoline Pump Components History](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php)
	-	Convert the abbreviated month-year string to datetime using `pd.to_datetime()` with `format='%b-%y'`.
  - If necessary, use the `Series.str.replace()` method.
    - For example, `Series.str.replace('A', 'B')` replaces "A" with "B" in `Series`.


```{python}
#| eval: false
Series = pd.to_datetime(Series, format='%b-%y')
```

- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.
