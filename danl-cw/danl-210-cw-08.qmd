# Question 1.

- Store the table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php)
  - To convert the abbreviated-month-and-year `string` into `datetime`, we can use the `format='%b-%y'` option in the `pd.to_datetime()` method

```{python}
#| eval: false
Series = pd.to_datetime(Series, format='%b-%y')
```

- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

# Question 2.
- Store each table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [https://www.geneseo.edu/business/student%20outcomes](https://www.geneseo.edu/business/student%20outcomes)

- To clean the table data, the following attribute and methods can be useful:
  - `DataFrame.iloc[0]` locates the first observation in `DataFrame`.
  - `DataFrame.drop( index = DataFrame.index[0] )` drops the first observation in `DataFrame`.
  - `Series.str.replace('A', 'B')` replaces "A" with "B" in `Series`.

- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

*Answer*:
```{python}
