```{r}
#| include: false

library(DT)
library(reticulate)
reticulate::use_condaenv("/Users/bchoe/anaconda3", required = TRUE)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/giphy-hacking-start.gif")
```


Below is to set up the web scrapping environment with Python `selenium`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
import pandas as pd
import os
import time
import random
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

wd_path = 'PATHNAME_FOR_YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY'   # 'YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY'
os.chdir(wd_path)
```

# Question 1

- Use Python Selenium to scrap the table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php)
  
- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

*Answer*:
```{python}

```

# Question 2

- Provide your Python Selenium code to scrape all the quotes in [this website](http://quotes.toscrape.com).

  - You should create the two DataFrames with the following variables:
  
  1. DataFrame about each quote with the following variables:
    - `quote`
    - `author`
    - `tags`
    - `about`, URL for description about each author.
  2. DataFrame about each author with the following variables:
    - `about`, URL for description about each author.
    - `born_date`
    - `born_location`
    - `author_description`


- Find the top 15 most frequently occurred tags.
- Save the two DataFrames in the CSV files.

*Answer*:
```{python}

```
