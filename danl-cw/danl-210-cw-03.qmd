# Question 1. Load a CSV file into pandas

In this question, you will **download a CSV file**, put it into a **data** folder, and then **load it into Python** using pandas.

## Step 1) Download the file
1. Go to **Brightspace → Course Files**.
2. Download **`custdata_rev.csv`** to your computer.

## Step 2) Create a `data` folder
In your course project folder (your **working directory**), create a folder named:

- `data`

Example:

- If your course folder is `DANL-210` and this folder is in your `Documents` folder, then you should have:
  - Mac: `'/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Documents/DANL-210/data'`
  - Windows: `'C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\Documents\\DANL-210\\data'`

## Step 3) Move the CSV file into `data`
Move `custdata_rev.csv` into the `data` folder so it looks like:

- Mac: `DANL-210/data/custdata_rev.csv`
- Windows: `DANL-210\\data\\custdata_rev.csv`

## Step 4) Set your working directory in Python
Replace the path below with the folder that contains your project (the folder that contains `data`).

```{.python}
import os
import pandas as pd

# Replace this with YOUR project folder path (the folder that contains the "data" folder)
wd_path = "ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY"

os.chdir(wd_path)      # set working directory
os.getcwd()            # check current working directory
```

## Step 5) Read the CSV in two ways

### (a) Using a relative path

If your working directory is set to the project folder, you can load the file like this:

```{.python}
path_relative = "data/custdata_rev.csv"

# Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
# pd.read_csv(...) loads the file and creates a table-like object (a DataFrame) in Python.
# After this line runs, df_rel will contain all rows and columns from the CSV.
df_rel = pd.read_csv(path_relative)
```

### (b) Using an absolute path

You can also load the file using the full path to the file:

```{.python}
path_absolute = "ABSOLUTE_PATHNAME_OF_custdata_rev.csv"
df_abs = pd.read_csv(path_absolute)
```

# Question 2. Scrapping a Web-table with `pd.read_csv()`

- Store the table in the following webpage as a **pandas** `DataFrame`:
  - [Gasoline Pump Components History](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php)



<!-- 	-	Convert the abbreviated month-year string to datetime using `pd.to_datetime()` with `format='%b-%y'`. -->
<!--   - If necessary, use the `Series.str.replace()` method. -->
<!--     - For example, `Series.str.replace('A', 'B')` replaces "A" with "B" in `Series`. -->

```{python}
#| echo: true

url_eia = "https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php"
```



```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
Series = pd.to_datetime(Series, format='%b-%y')
```

- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

*Answer*:
```{python}

```

# Question 3. Scrapping Multiple Web-tables with `pd.read_csv()`
- Store each table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [https://www.geneseo.edu/business/student%20outcomes](https://www.geneseo.edu/business/student%20outcomes)


```{python}
#| echo: true

url_geneseo = "https://www.geneseo.edu/business/student%20outcomes"
```


<!-- - Ensure each table has appropriate column names and properly structured observations. -->

- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

*Answer*:
```{python}

```
