Below is the `health_ins` DataFrame that loads data from the file **health_ins.csv**, which contains information about health insurance customers.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
health_ins = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/custdata_rev2.csv')
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

rmarkdown::paged_table(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/custdata_rev2.csv'),
                       options = list(rows.print = 25))
```

<br><br>

## Question 1
Select the columns **custid**, **sex**, **income**, and **age**. Then sort the DataFrame by **income** in descending order and display the top 10 entries.



*Answer*

```{python}

```


<br><br>


## Question 2
Using `set_index()`, change the DataFrame’s index to **custid**. Then locate the data for a specific customer, for example **000260181_01**, and display their **is_employed**, **income**, and **marital_status**.



*Answer*
```{python}

```


<br><br>


## Question 3
Find the 5 customers with the highest **income** and calculate their average **age**. (Reset the index if it was previously changed.)



*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>




## Question 4
Sort the DataFrame by **state_of_res** (alphabetically) and **income** (in descending order). Then set **custid** as the index and use the `loc` accessor to retrieve the **income** for a specific customer, say **_000331510_01_**.

*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>


## Question 5
Create a new variable called **Wealth_Score** defined as the sum of **income** and 10,000 multiplied by **num_vehicles**. Then sort the DataFrame first by **housing_type** alphabetically, and within each housing type, by **Wealth_Score** in descending order.


*Answer*
```{python}

```


<br><br>




## Question 6
Select customers with an **income** greater than 50,000. For these customers, calculate a new variable **income_per_age** (defined as **income** divided by **age**), and then find the customer with the highest **income_per_age**. Display their **custid** and **income_per_age**.


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>




## Question 7
Create a new DataFrame that includes only customers who are Employed. Select the variables **custid**, **sex**, **income**, **marital_status**, and **state_of_res**. Additionally, include a new variable **Employment_Status** that duplicates the **is_employed** variable.



*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>

## Question 8

Determine how many customers have an **income** within the top 10% of the DataFrame.


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>


## Question 9
Filter the DataFrame for customers who have **recent_move** equal to _1_ and also have health insurance (i.e., **health_ins** equals _1_).


*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>




## Question 10
Find the unique values of **gas_usage** and count how many unique gas usage patterns there are in the DataFrame.


*Answer*
```{python}

```



<br><br>


## Question 11
Identify the customer(s) with the highest number of vehicles (i.e., the highest **num_vehicles**). Display their **custid**, **sex**, and **num_vehicles**.



*Answer*
```{python}

```

<br><br>


## Question 12
Calculate the percentage of missing values for each variable in the DataFrame.


*Answer*
```{python}

```


<br><br>



## Question 13
Fill missing values in the **marital_status** column with the string **Unknown**.


*Answer*
```{python}

```

## Question 17
- Reshape the `nba_ff` DataFrame into a DataFrame called `nba_ff_long` that includes the variables **game_id**, **team_id**, **team_name**, **team_abbreviation**, **team_city**, and **min**, along with two new variables:
	-	**factor**: indicates the statistic from the following columns: _efg_pct_, _fta_rate_, _tm_tov_pct_, _oreb_pct_, _opp_efg_pct_, _opp_fta_rate_, _opp_tov_pct_, _opp_oreb_pct_;
	-	**value**: contains the corresponding values for the factor.

Finally, sort `nba_ff_long` by _game_id_, _team_id_, and _Factor_ in ascending order.
