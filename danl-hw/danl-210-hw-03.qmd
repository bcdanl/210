# Question 1. Collecting the IMDB Data using Python `Selenium`

<br>

</p>

<br>

- Go to the following IMDB webpage for 
  - [Top 200 Family Movies and TV Shows (sorted by Popularity)](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?genres=family&sort=popularity,desc&count=200).
 
- Provide your Python Selenium code to scrape the following information about **Top 200 Family Movies and TV Shows by Popularity**. 
  - You should create the following variables in the DataFrame:
    - `ranking`	(e.g., 1, 2, 3)
    - `title`	(e.g., *Snow White, Freakier Friday*)
    - `year`	(e.g., 2025, 2025-)
    - `runtime`	(e.g., 1h 56m, 1h 40m)
    - `rating` (e.g., PG, TV-G, G)
    - `imdb_score` (e.g., 7.6, 6.5)
    - `votes` (e.g., 1.4k, 70k)
    - `metascore`	(e.g., 56, 74)
    - `plot` (e.g., *A princess joins forces with seven dwarfs to liberate her kingdom from her cruel stepmother the Evil Queen.*)


- Suppose `ranking` and `title` are initially combined in a single column called `ranking_title`, with values like:
  - "1. Snow White"
  - "2. Freakier Friday"
- You can split this column into `ranking` and `title` using the following code:

```{.python}
# Split the 'ranking_title' column into two new variables, 'ranking' and 'title'
# by the first occurrence of a period (dot). 

# n=1 ensures the split to be limited to the first dot.
# expand=True tells pandas to return the results in a DataFrame
  # If expand were False, the result would be a Series of lists.

df[['ranking', 'title']] = df['ranking_title'].str.split('.', n=1, expand=True)
df = df.drop(columns=['ranking_title'])
```

- Finally, export the resulting DataFrame to the CSV file.


*Answer*:

```{python}

```

# Question 2. Pandas Basic

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/spotify.png" width="400px">
</p>

<br>

Below is `spotify` `DataFrame` that reads the file `spotify_all.csv` containing data of Spotify users' playlist information (Source: [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)).

```{.python}
spotify = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv')
```


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

rmarkdown::paged_table(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv'),
                       options = list(rows.print = 25))
```

<br>

## Variable Description

- `pid`: playlist ID; unique ID for playlist
- `playlist_name`: a name of playlist
- `pos`: a position of the track within a playlist (starting from 0)
- `artist_name`: name of the track’s primary artist
- `track_name`: name of the track
- `duration_ms`: duration of the track in milliseconds
- `album_name`: name of the track’s album


## Definition of a Song
- In Question 2, a **song** is defined as a combination of a `artist_name` value and a `track_name` value.

- E.g., the following provides the 12 difference songs with the same `track_name`---**I Love You**:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

rmarkdown::paged_table(
  read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv') |> 
  count(artist_name, track_name) |> 
  filter(track_name == 'I Love You') |> 
  select(-n), 
  options = list(rows.print = 12)
)
```

<br>

## Q2a

- Write a Python code to identify the top five songs with the highest frequency of appearances in the `spotify` DataFrame.


*Answer*:

```{python}

```

<br>

## Q2b

- Write a Python code to create a DataFrame that contains information about how often each song occurs within the `spotify` DataFrame.
  - In this new DataFrame, each observation should represent a distinct song.

- Then, write a Python code to identify top 5% songs based on their frequency of appearances.


*Answer*:

```{python}

```


<br>


## Q2c
- Write a Python code to list all artists who have more than 50 unique songs in the `sportify` DataFrame.


*Answer*:

```{python}

*Answer*:

```{python}

```

<br>

## Q2e
- Write a Python code to identify the longest and shortest duration songs (based on `duration_ms`) for each unique artist.


*Answer*:

```{python}

```

<br>



## Q2f
