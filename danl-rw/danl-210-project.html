<li><p><strong>Title</strong>: A clear and concise title that gives an idea of the project topics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Provide context for the research questions, explaining why they are significant, relevant, or interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Statement of the Problem</strong>: Clearly articulate the specific problem or issue the project will address.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Use a Python script (<code>*.py</code>) to write the code and the comment on how to retrieve financial, accounting, and ESG data using Python <code>yfinance</code> and <code>selenium</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do NOT provide your code for data collection in your webpage. You should submit your Python script for data collection to Brightspace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Provide both grouped and un-grouped descriptive statistics and distribution plots for the ESG data and the finance/accounting data</li>
<li>Provide correlation heat maps using <code>corr()</code> and <code>seaborn.heatmap()</code>. Below provides the Python code for creating a correlation heatmap.</li>
