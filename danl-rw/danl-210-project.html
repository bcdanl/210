<p>For data collection, include only the companies that are common to both the <code>esg_proj_2024_data</code> and <code>esg_proj_2025</code> DataFrames.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scraping web data falls into a legal gray area. In the U.S., scraping publicly available information is not illegal, but it is not always clearly allowed either.
<ul>
<li>Most companies do not go after individuals for minor or non-commercial violations of their Terms of Service (ToS). Still, if the scraping causes harm, it can lead to legal trouble.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tips for Collecting Data from <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Finance</a>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Scrape at a reasonable and moderate rate. To avoid overloading servers, use <code>time.sleep(random.uniform(5, y))</code> between page visits.</li>
<li>The method of explicit waits are not required, but they are helpful for ensuring elements load before scraping.</li>
<li>Be aware that some companies may not have data available for Environmental, Social, or Governance Risk Scores, or Controversy Level.</li>
<li>Consider starting with the following setup for Selenium web-scrapping</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpreting-esg-data-on-yahoo-finance">Interpreting ESG Data on Yahoo Finance 🧾</h2>
<p>In <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>, the <strong>ESG data</strong> helps investors evaluate a company’s sustainability profile and exposure to long-term environmental, social, and governance risks. Here’s how to interpret each metric:</p>
<section id="total-esg-risk-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="total-esg-risk-score">🔢 <strong>Total ESG Risk Score</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it means</strong>: A composite score reflecting the company’s overall <strong>exposure to ESG-related risks</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>How to interpret</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower score = lower risk</strong> → Better ESG performance.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Higher score = higher risk</strong> → More vulnerable to ESG-related issues.<br>
</li>
<li><em>Example</em>: A company with <strong>total_ESG = 15</strong> is considered to have <strong>lower ESG risk</strong> than one with <strong>total_ESG = 30</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="environmental-risk-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="environmental-risk-score">🌍 <strong>Environmental Risk Score</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it measures</strong>: Exposure to <strong>environmental risks</strong> such as:
<ul>
<li>Carbon emissions<br>
</li>
<li>Energy efficiency<br>
</li>
<li>Waste management<br>
</li>
<li>Climate change strategy<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lower score → better environmental practices.</li>
<li>Higher score → more environmental liabilities or poor sustainability measures.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="social-risk-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-risk-score">👥 <strong>Social Risk Score</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it measures</strong>: Exposure to <strong>social risks</strong>, including:
<ul>
<li>Labor practices<br>
</li>
<li>Human rights<br>
</li>
<li>Inclusive culture and representation</li>
<li>Customer and community relations<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lower score = better social responsibility.</li>
<li>Higher score = more risk from labor issues, PR problems, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="governance-risk-score" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="governance-risk-score">🏛 <strong>Governance Risk Score</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it measures</strong>: Exposure to <strong>governance-related risks</strong>, such as:
<ul>
<li>Board structure and independence<br>
</li>
<li>Executive compensation<br>
</li>
<li>Shareholder rights<br>
</li>
<li>Transparency and ethics<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Lower score suggests better corporate oversight.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="controversy-level">🚨 <strong>Controversy Level</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What it measures</strong>: Reflects <strong>recent ESG-related controversies</strong> involving the company.</li>
<li><strong>Scale</strong>: Usually ranges from <strong>0 (no controversies)</strong> to <strong>5 (severe and ongoing issues)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Low score (0–1)</strong>: Minimal or no controversies.</li>
<li><strong>High score (4–5)</strong>: Major controversies — potential reputational or legal risks.</li>
<li><em>Note</em>: A company may have good ESG scores but still be flagged due to a high controversy score.</li>

<section id="distribution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<p>When describing the distribution of a variable, we are typically interested in several key characteristics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Center</strong>: The central tendency of the data, such as the <strong>mean</strong> or <strong>median</strong>, which indicates the <strong>typical or average value</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spread</strong>: How spread the values are within the variable, showing the <strong>range</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> of values.</li>
<li><strong>Common Values</strong>: Identifying frequent values and the <strong>mode</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Rare Values</strong>: Recognizing unusual or infrequent values.</li>
<li><strong>Shape</strong>: The overall shape of the distribution, such as whether it’s symmetric, skewed left or right, or having multiple groups with multiple peaks.</li>
</ol>

<section id="relationship-between-two-variables" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationship-between-two-variables">Relationship Between Two Variables</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start with determining whether the two variables have a <strong>positive association</strong>, a <strong>negative association</strong>, or <strong>no association</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>E.g., A negative slope in the fitted line indicates that sales decrease as the price increases, while a positive slope would indicate that sales increase with price. A zero slope means that there is no relationship between sales and price; changes in price do not affect sales.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
<img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/corr-direction.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">
</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Input on the x-axis; output on the y-axis</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>By convention, the input (or predictor) variable is plotted on the x-axis, and the output (or response) variable on the y-axis.</li>
<li>This helps visualize potential relationships—though it shows correlation, not necessarily causation.</li>
<li>Correlation does not necessarily mean causation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>When a question asks you to describe how the relationship varies by another categorical variable, examine both <strong>the direction of the slope</strong> (negative, positive, or none) from the fitted line and <strong>the steepness of the slope</strong> (steep or shallow).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The slope of the fitted straight line is the rate at which the “y” variable (like grades) changes as the “x” variable (like study hours) changes. In simple terms, it shows how much one thing goes up or down when the other thing changes.</li>
<li>For example, a comment such as, “The plot shows a negative relationship between sales and price” does not address how the relationship differs by brand.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>The focus is on the relationship, not the distribution.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>While adding a comment on the distribution of a single variable can be helpful, the question is primarily about the relationship between the two variables.</li>
</ul>

<section id="time-trend-of-a-variable" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-trend-of-a-variable">Time Trend of a Variable</h3>
<p>Here are some general tips for describing the time trend of a variable:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Start with Identifying the Overall Trend</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Look for <strong>the general direction of the trend over time</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Is it moving <strong>upward</strong>, <strong>downward</strong>, or <strong>remaining relatively constant</strong>?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Note Patterns and Cycles</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Identify any repeating patterns, such as <strong>seasonal fluctuations</strong> (e.g., monthly or quarterly changes) or <strong>long-term cycles</strong>.
<ul>
<li>These can reveal consistent influences that affect the variable over time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Highlight Any Significant Fluctuations</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Describe any <strong>sharp increases, decreases</strong>, or <strong>irregular spikes</strong> in the data.</li>
</ul>

<section id="interpreting-visualization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interpreting-visualization">Interpreting Visualization</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be specific.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Avoid vague statements. Below examples do not actually explain what the patterns are.
<ul>
<li>“The plot shows how the time trend of a stock price varies across sectors, with each sector having a unique best fitting line and scatter pattern”</li>
<li>“The trend shows the evolution of stock price in the market over time”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clearly describe what is the pattern—and how it differs across categories.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Add Narration</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Connect the visualization to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening.</li>
