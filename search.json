We will work primarily in Jupyter Notebook, an interactive environment for exploratory computing and reproducible analysis.\nKey topics include: (1) loading, cleaning, transforming, merging, and reshaping data; (2) creating clear and informative visualizations; (3) slicing, summarizing, and reporting insights; and (4) collecting data from the web and online services. Throughout the semester, you will apply these skills to solve a wide range of data analysis problems using Python, including core tools such as Pandas, as well as data-collection methods using Selenium and application programming interfaces (APIs)."

You must sign in to be credited for attending class. If you attend class and do not sign in, it will be considered the equivalent of an absence.\nYou are provided with 5 unexcused absences per semester. Any additional unexcused absences will be subject to reducing your final grade by one letter grade for each additional absence (6 total absences = 1 letter grade (A to A–), 7 total absences = 2 letter grades (A to B+), etc.)\nFor extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students, who can assist with contacting your faculty."

Refrain from posting unrelated links, comments, thoughts, or images.\n\nAvoid typing in all caps, as it may appear as if you’re shouting.\n\nSteer clear of writing anything that might be interpreted as angry or sarcastic, particularly as tone is hard to convey online.\n\nAlways use “Please” and “Thank you” when requesting assistance from peers or instructors.\n\nRespect differing viewpoints. If disagreeing, do so respectfully and acknowledge the merits of your classmates’ arguments.\n\nEnsure accuracy when responding to a peer’s query. If unsure, especially about deadlines, it’s better not to guess to avoid confusion.\n\nBe concise in your responses; lengthy replies to simple questions might not be read fully.\n\nIf multiple responses are received to your question, consider summarizing them for the benefit of the entire class.\n\nAvoid derogatory comments or insulting others’ intelligence. Disagree with ideas, not individuals.\n\nWhen referencing a previous discussion, quote only the essential lines to provide context without requiring others to search for the original post.\n\nPractice forgiveness. If a peer makes an error, do not dwell on it; everyone makes mistakes.\n\nBefore posting, run a spell and grammar check. This small effort can significantly impact how your message is perceived."

    "text": "Research 4: Climate Finance with Renegotiations\n\nChoe, B.-H., “Climate Finance under Limited Commitment and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract Approach” (2026)\n\nUsing climate funds (e.g., the Green Climate Fund) as the main mechanism for financing developing countries, this paper studies a long-term funding relationship between a rich and a poor country.\n\nThe parties disagree over (1) the level of funding and (2) how to allocate it between adaptation and mitigation. Commitment is limited, and contracts may be renegotiated each period with some probability.\n\nMain results: Less frequent renegotiation improves contract efficiency and reduces inequality between the countries.\n\nThese findings suggest design principles for climate funds: strengthen commitment and limit renegotiation, especially as climate risks intensify."
