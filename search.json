    "text": "Getting a GitHub account\nStep 1. Create the GitHub account with your Geneseo email.\n\nGo to GitHub.\nClick “Sign up for GitHub”.\n\n\nChoose your GitHub username carefully:\n\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io will be the address for your website.\nByeong-Hak’s GitHub username is bcdanl, so that Byeong-Hak owns the web address https://bcdanl.github.io.\n\nIt is recommended to have a username with all lower cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling git if you do not have one.\nStep 2.\n\nCheck whether git is installed in your laptop.\n\n\nFrom the Console Pane in RStudio, click Terminal tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Terminal, run the following command to check if your laptop has git installed.\n\ngit --version\n\nIf your computer has git installed, you will see the message below and you do not need to install git:\n\ngit version 2.xx\n\nIf your computer does not have git installed, you will see the message below and you need to install git:\n\n'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n\n\nInstall git if you do not have one. Move to the next step if you have git installed in your laptop.\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\nGo to http://git-scm.com/downloads, and download the file.\nClick “macOS”, scroll down the webpage, and then click “installer” from the Binary installer section.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nGo to https://gitforwindows.org, and download the file.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep clicking “Next” to complete the installation of git.\nAfter the git installation is done, close RStudio and re-open it.\n\n\nHow to open git installation file on Mac?\n\nRun the downloaded file.\nClick Okay\nGo to “Setting” &gt; “Privacy and Security”\nGo to “General” or scroll down\nClick “Open Anyway”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up GitHub Credential on your local Git.\nStep 3. In Terminal, run the following commands one by one:\ngit config --global user.email \"YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS\"\ngit config --global user.name \"YOUR_USERNAME\"\nFor example, the email address for my GitHub account is bchoe@geneseo.edu, and my GitHub username is bcdanl, so that I ran below:\ngit config --global user.email \"bchoe@geneseo.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"bcdanl\"\n\nStep 4. Obtain a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThen, click “Generate token” in the pop-upped web browser.\nWe can think of GitHub’s personal access token as a password that expires. You can decide how long it remains valid. My recommendation is to set its expiration for May 31, 2025, or later.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, copy the generated PAT, and paste it to your clipboard or R script.\n\n\nStep 5. Set the GitHub credential using the PAT.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nYou will be asked to provide your PAT.\nPaste your PAT to the RStudio Console, and then hit Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIt does not harm to create multiple PAT for one GitHub account.\nAfter the PAT expires, you should repeat the following if you want to update your GitHub website:\n\n\nCreate a new PAT:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nReplace the current PAT with the new PAT:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nSelect the option 2: Replace these credentials by typing 2 and hitting Enter on R Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing the Connection between GitHub repo and your local Git\nStep 6. Login to your GitHib and make the repository.\n\nFrom https://github.com, click the plus [+] icon in the upper right corner and select “New repository”.\nName this repo USERNAME.github.io, which will be the domain for your website.\n\n\ne.g., If your GitHub username is abc9, the name of your repo should be abc9.github.io, not abc_9.github.io.\n\n\nThen, copy the web address of your GitHub repo, https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\n\nFor example, the web address for Byeong-Hak’s GitHub repo is https://github.com/bcdanl/bcdanl.github.io.\n\n\nStep 7. Create a RStudio project with Version Control\n\n\n\n\nClick “Project (None)” at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick “New Project” &gt; “Version Control” &gt; “Git”\nPaste the web address of your GitHub repo to the Repository URL menu.\nClick “Browse” to select the parent directory for your local project directory (I recommend “Documents” folder.)\nClick “Create”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf Step 7 does not work on your laptop, try below Steps 7-1 and 7-2 instead. If Step 7 DOES work well, skip Steps 7-1 and 7-2.\n\n\nStep 7-1. Use git clone to establish the connection between GitHub repo and your local laptop:\n\nChange directory to “Documents” in Terminal using cd command.\n\ncd &lt;pathname of \"Documents\" directory&gt;\n\nHere, you need to know the pathname of “Documents” directory.\nFor example, LAPTOP_USERNAME below is not your GitHub username but one for your local laptop.\n\nMac\ncd /Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\nWindows\ncd C:/Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\n\nUse git clone to creates a local copy of the GitHub Repository.\n\ngit clone &lt;repository-url&gt;\n\nFor example,\n\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\nStep 7-2. Create a RStudio project from Existing Directory\n\nClick “Project (None)” at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick “New Project” &gt; “Existing Directory”\nClick “Browse” to select the local copy of the GitHub Repository\nClick “Create Project”\n\n\n\n\nDownloading Website Template Files\nStep 8. Download the files of website template:\n\nGo to the following webpage: https://github.com/bcdanl/danl-website-template\nFrom the webpage above, click the green icon &lt; &gt; Code, and then click “Download Zip”\nExtract the Zip file you have downloaded\nIf there are the files, .gitignore, .DS_Store, or *.Rproj, in the folder, delete all of them.\nMove all the files that were compressed in the Zip file to your local project directory, USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nSelect all the files in the danl-website-template folder (Tip: Ctrl + A (Windows) / command + A (Mac) selects all files in a directory).\nThen, Ctrl + C (Windows) / command + C (Mac) to copy them.\nThen, go to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\nThen, Ctrl + V (Windows) / command + V (Mac) to paste them to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nRemove the danl-website-template directory from your local project directory, if you have one.\n\n\nAll the website files should be located at the same level with the R Project file (USERNAME.github.io.Rproj), shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing the Website Files to the GitHub repository\n\n\n\nStep 8. Push the files to your GitHub repository\n\nOn Terminal within RStudio, execute the following 3-step git commands, which will stage, commit, and push all the files in the local working directory to your GitHub repository:\n\n\ngit add . adds changes in your local working directory (e.g., edited files, new files, deleted files) to the staging area, which is a temporary area where you can prepare your next commit\n\ngit add .\n\ngit commit -m \"...\" records the changes in the staging area as a new snapshot in the local working directory, along with a message describing the changes.\n\ngit commit -m \"any message to describe the changes\"\n\ngit push uploads the local changes to the online repository in GitHub.\n\ngit push\n\nStep 9. Check whether the files are well uploaded.\n\nGo to the webpages of your GitHub repository and your website:\n\nhttps://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io\nRefresh the webpages (Ctrl + R for Windows users; cmd + R for Mac users)\n\nAdd a URL for your website (https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/) in About section in your GihtHub repository webpage by clicking the setting. Below describes how to do it:\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWelcome to our Classwork 1 Discussion Board! 👋 \nThis space is designed for you to engage with your classmates about the material covered in Classwork 1.\nWhether you are looking to delve deeper into the content, share insights, or have questions about the content, this is the perfect place for you.\nIf you have any specific questions for Byeong-Hak (@bcdanl) regarding the Classwork 1 materials or need clarification on any points, don’t hesitate to ask here.\nAll comments will be stored here.\nLet’s collaborate and learn from each other!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1. Data Collection\nFor data collection, include only the companies that are common to both the esg_proj_2024_data and esg_proj_2025 DataFrames.\n\nScraping web data falls into a legal gray area. In the U.S., scraping publicly available information is not illegal, but it is not always clearly allowed either.\n\nMost companies do not go after individuals for minor or non-commercial violations of their Terms of Service (ToS). Still, if the scraping causes harm, it can lead to legal trouble.\n\nTips for Collecting Data from Yahoo! Finance:\n\nScrape at a reasonable and moderate rate. To avoid overloading servers, use time.sleep(random.uniform(5, y)) between page visits.\nThe method of explicit waits are not required, but they are helpful for ensuring elements load before scraping.\nBe aware that some companies may not have data available for Environmental, Social, or Governance Risk Scores, or Controversy Level.\nConsider starting with the following setup for Selenium web-scrapping\n\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup libraries\n# =============================================================================\nimport time\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup working directory\n# =============================================================================\nwd_path = 'PATHNAME_OF_YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY'\nos.chdir(wd_path)\n\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup WebDriver with options\n# =============================================================================\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"window-size=1400,1200\")  # Set window size\noptions.add_argument('--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled')  # Prevent detection of automation by disabling blink features\noptions.page_load_strategy = 'eager'  # Load only essential content first, skipping non-critical resources\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)\n\n\na. ESG Data\n\nFor each company in the esg_proj_2025 DataFrame, employ the Python selenium library to gather ESG Risk Ratings, along with the Controversy Level from the Sustainability section of each company’s webpage on Yahoo! Finance, such as:\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT)\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Historical Stock Data\n\nFor each company found in both the esg_proj_2024_data and esg_proj_2025 DataFrames, employ the selenium library to retrieve:\n\nDaily stock prices from January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025\n\ne.g., https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history/?p=MSFT&period1=1704067200&period2=1743446400\n1704067200 = January 1, 2024\n1743446400 = March 31, 2025\n\n\nNote: GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets is freely available for retrieving current or historical stock data.\n\nAlthough our course does not cover Google Sheets, you are welcome to use it to collect historical stock data if you prefer.\nIf you choose Google Sheets’ GOOGLEFINANCE() for collecting historical stock data, please share your Google Sheets with Prof. Choe.\n\n\n\n\nDividend Cleaning\nIf you scrape historical data tables from each company’s page on Yahoo Finance (e.g., MSFT Historical Data), you can construct a DataFrame similar to the df_all DataFrame shown below.\nThe df_all DataFrame contains stock data for Apple Inc., Microsoft, and Nvidia from the beginning of 2024 through the end of Q1 2025:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf_all = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/aapl_msft_nvda_2024_2025.csv')\n\n  \n\nNote that some rows in the df_all DataFrame include dividend declarations rather than price and volume data (e.g., Apple Inc. on February 10, 2025; Microsoft on February 20, 2025). These dividend entries appear in the Open/High/Low/Close/Adj Close/Volume columns as strings like “0.25 Dividend”.\n\nNote: Apple Inc’s “0.25 Dividend” means that on that specific date, Apple Inc issued a cash dividend of $0.01 per share.\n\nTo separate these dividend entries from the actual stock trading data, we use the str.contains() method:\n# Filter rows where the 'Open' column contains the word 'Dividend' (these represent dividend entries)\ndf_dividend = df_all[df_all['Open'].str.contains('Dividend', na=False)]\n\n# Filter out dividend rows to keep only stock price data\ndf_stock = df_all[~df_all['Open'].str.contains('Dividend', na=False)]\n\nAt this point:\n\ndf_stock does not include dividend announcements.\ndf_dividend includes only dividend announcements.\n\n\nWe now clean and format the dividend information:\n# Select only relevant columns for dividend data\ndf_dividend = df_dividend[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Open']]\n\n# Copy 'Open' column (which contains dividend information) into a new column named 'Dividend'\ndf_dividend['Dividend'] = df_dividend['Open']\n\n# Keep only the necessary columns: Date, Symbol, and Dividend\ndf_dividend = df_dividend[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Dividend']]\n\n# Remove the text \" Dividend\" from the Dividend column to isolate the numeric value\ndf_dividend['Dividend'] = df_dividend['Dividend'].str.replace(' Dividend', '')\n\n\n\nStock Split Cleaning\nSimilarly, some row in the df_stock DataFrame from the “Dividend Cleaning” subsection includes stock splits rather than price and volume data (e.g., Nvidia on June 10, 2024). These stock split entries appear in the Open/High/Low/Close/Adj Close/Volume columns as strings like “10:1 Stock Splits”.\nTo separate these stock split entries from the actual stock trading data, again we use the str.contains() method:\n# Filter rows where the 'Open' column contains the word 'Split' (these represent stock split entries)\ndf_split = df_stock[df_stock['Open'].str.contains('Split', na=False)]\n\n# Filter out dividend rows to keep only stock price data\ndf_stock = df_stock[~df_stock['Open'].str.contains('Split', na=False)]\n\nAt this point:\n\ndf_stock includes only daily stock trading information.\ndf_split includes only stock splits.\n\n\nWe now clean and format the split information:\n# Select only relevant columns for dividend data\ndf_split = df_split[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Open']]\n\n# Copy 'Open' column (which contains dividend information) into a new column named 'Split'\ndf_split['Split'] = df_split['Open']\n\n# Keep only the necessary columns: Date, Symbol, and Split\ndf_split = df_split[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Split']]\n\n# Remove the text \" Stock Splits\" from the Split column to isolate the numeric value\ndf_split['Split'] = df_split['Split'].str.replace(' Stock Splits', '')\n\nNote: NVDA’s “10:1 Stock Split” means that each existing share was split into 10 shares.\n\nIf you owned 1 share before June 10, 2024, you would own 10 shares after the split.\nTo maintain consistency, Yahoo Finance retroactively adjusts all historical prices and volumes to reflect stock splits.\n\nFor example, the table below shows NVDA’s adjusted stock prices and volumes from June 7–11, 2024:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nExtracting the year from a datetime variable\n\nTo extract the year from a datetime variable in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the .dt.year accessor.\n\n# Sample DataFrame with string dates\ndata = {\n    'Symbol': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'],\n    'Date': ['2024-12-29', '2024-12-30', '2025-01-03'],\n    'Close': [130.21, 265.78, 122.34]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert 'Date' column to datetime\ndf['Date'] = df['Date'].astype('datetime64[ns]')\n\n# Extract year from 'Date' variable\ndf['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year"

    "text": "General Tips on Data Visualization 📈\n\nDistribution\nWhen describing the distribution of a variable, we are typically interested in several key characteristics:\n\nCenter: The central tendency of the data, such as the mean or median, which indicates the typical or average value.\nSpread: How spread the values are within the variable, showing the range and standard deviation of values.\nCommon Values: Identifying frequent values and the mode.\nRare Values: Recognizing unusual or infrequent values.\nShape: The overall shape of the distribution, such as whether it’s symmetric, skewed left or right, or having multiple groups with multiple peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Two Variables\n\nStart with determining whether the two variables have a positive association, a negative association, or no association.\n\n\nE.g., A negative slope in the fitted line indicates that sales decrease as the price increases, while a positive slope would indicate that sales increase with price. A zero slope means that there is no relationship between sales and price; changes in price do not affect sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput on the x-axis; output on the y-axis\n\n\nBy convention, the input (or predictor) variable is plotted on the x-axis, and the output (or response) variable on the y-axis.\nThis helps visualize potential relationships—though it shows correlation, not necessarily causation.\nCorrelation does not necessarily mean causation.\n\n\nWhen a question asks you to describe how the relationship varies by another categorical variable, examine both the direction of the slope (negative, positive, or none) from the fitted line and the steepness of the slope (steep or shallow).\n\n\nThe slope of the fitted straight line is the rate at which the “y” variable (like grades) changes as the “x” variable (like study hours) changes. In simple terms, it shows how much one thing goes up or down when the other thing changes.\nFor example, a comment such as, “The plot shows a negative relationship between sales and price” does not address how the relationship differs by brand.\n\n\nThe focus is on the relationship, not the distribution.\n\n\nWhile adding a comment on the distribution of a single variable can be helpful, the question is primarily about the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\nTime Trend of a Variable\nHere are some general tips for describing the time trend of a variable:\n\nStart with Identifying the Overall Trend\n\n\nLook for the general direction of the trend over time.\n\nIs it moving upward, downward, or remaining relatively constant?\n\n\n\nNote Patterns and Cycles\n\n\nIdentify any repeating patterns, such as seasonal fluctuations (e.g., monthly or quarterly changes) or long-term cycles.\n\nThese can reveal consistent influences that affect the variable over time.\n\n\n\nHighlight Any Significant Fluctuations\n\n\nDescribe any sharp increases, decreases, or irregular spikes in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Visualization\n\nBe specific.\n\nAvoid vague statements. Below examples do not actually explain what the patterns are.\n\n“The plot shows how the time trend of a stock price varies across sectors, with each sector having a unique best fitting line and scatter pattern”\n“The trend shows the evolution of stock price in the market over time”\n\nClearly describe what is the pattern—and how it differs across categories.\n\nAdd Narration:\n\nConnect the visualization to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening."

Let’s create a box plot to visualize the salary distribution for each position. ​​\n\n\nCode\n# Plot salary distribution by player position\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(data = nba,\n            x = 'Position', y = 'Salary',\n            palette = 'Set2')\nplt.title('Salary Distribution by Position')\nplt.xlabel('Position')\nplt.ylabel('Salary')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot above illustrates the salary distribution by player position, showcasing the variation in salaries among different positions within the NBA. This visualization helps us understand which positions tend to have higher median salaries and the spread of salaries within each position, including outliers that represent exceptionally high or low salaries. While the positions of C and PG have the widest interquantiles of salaries, the positions of FC, F, G, and GF have the narrowest interquantiles of them."
