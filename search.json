We will work primarily in Jupyter Notebook, an interactive environment for exploratory computing and reproducible analysis.\nKey topics include: (1) loading, cleaning, transforming, merging, and reshaping data; (2) creating clear and informative visualizations; (3) slicing, summarizing, and reporting insights; and (4) collecting data from the web and online services. Throughout the semester, you will apply these skills to solve a wide range of data analysis problems using Python, including core tools such as Pandas, as well as data-collection methods using Selenium and application programming interfaces (APIs)."

You must sign in to be credited for attending class. If you attend class and do not sign in, it will be considered the equivalent of an absence.\nYou are provided with 5 unexcused absences per semester. Any additional unexcused absences will be subject to reducing your final grade by one letter grade for each additional absence (6 total absences = 1 letter grade (A to A–), 7 total absences = 2 letter grades (A to B+), etc.)\nFor extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students, who can assist with contacting your faculty."

If disagreeing, do so respectfully and acknowledge the merits of your classmates’ arguments.\n\nEnsure accuracy when responding to a peer’s query. If unsure, especially about deadlines, it’s better not to guess to avoid confusion.\n\nBe concise in your responses; lengthy replies to simple questions might not be read fully.\n\nIf multiple responses are received to your question, consider summarizing them for the benefit of the entire class.\n\nAvoid derogatory comments or insulting others’ intelligence. Disagree with ideas, not individuals.\n\nWhen referencing a previous discussion, quote only the essential lines to provide context without requiring others to search for the original post.\n\nPractice forgiveness. If a peer makes an error, do not dwell on it; everyone makes mistakes.\n\nBefore posting, run a spell and grammar check. This small effort can significantly impact how your message is perceived."
